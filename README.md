# airlinePriorityQueue

C program that reads in passenger data from a .txt file, stores the passengers in a max heap based on a
priority number that is computed by (Total mileage / 1000) + years - sequence number. The priority queue
is then printed after the passengers are ordered into a min heap and sorted using heap sort.
